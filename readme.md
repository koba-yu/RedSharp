# RedSharp
A set of general Red functions with similar syntax to .NET C# methods.  
The function design goes along common usability of C# and Red.  
List of implemented functions is [here](https://github.com/koba-yu/RedSharp/wiki/Implemented-functions)

# For what I make this repo?
## 1st Reason
I love Red, it is very fascinating. However it is still under active development. On the other hand .NET has a large number of classes and methods. Some of them are so convenient that I sometimes want to have equivalant functions when I use other languages.

## 2nd Reason
Because I have not been fully experienced with Red, it is good practice for me to make porting Red functions from .NET. Also, I expect this repo might teach us how short Red's code could be!
